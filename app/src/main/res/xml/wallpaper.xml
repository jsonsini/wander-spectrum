WanderSpectrum is an Android live wallpaper that animates a vertical stripe aligned down the center
of the screen displaying the visible spectrum in a cyclic pattern.  The animation is randomly
generated to follow an approximate Brownian motion pattern.  The speed of movement, effective pixel
size, frame rate of animation, and minimum duration to switch direction of movement are all
configurable.
