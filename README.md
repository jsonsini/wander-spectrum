# WanderSpectrum
WanderSpectrum is an Android live wallpaper that animates a vertical stripe aligned down the center of the screen displaying the visible spectrum in a cyclic pattern.  The animation is randomly generated to follow an approximate Brownian motion pattern.  The speed of movement, effective pixel size, frame rate of animation, and minimum duration to switch direction of movement are all configurable.
